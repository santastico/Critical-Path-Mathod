This repository contains a Python implementation of the Critical Path Method (CPM).

The script calculates the earliest and latest start/finish times for each task, identifies the slack, and traces the critical path that determines the minimum project duration.

We apply this method to a real-world case from Vallourec, modeling the production planning for a new seamless steel tube and determining the bottlenecks in the process.

In order to run your code you need to install pandas and create a .csv file containing the information as the example provided.
